This is a small project I made to get some more knowledge and experience in TypeScript. I also would like to add a backend at some point to this project in Rust or NodeJS. CSS is still a bit broken on mobile view but will be fixed at some point.

To Run Project:
  - Download for GitHub
  - run "npm install"
  - run "npm run dev"
